<BR>This story is about a man, that is the most wonderful person I have ever met, about the most amazing guy, about the kindest person, about a man that has a lot of love in his soul and heart. About Alfredo.

My beloved Alfredo.</BR>

<BR>This story started almost 2 years ago. When we met, we both had a bad period in our lives, we didn't believe in us... That time in my life appeared Alfredo. It was a weird meeting: we started talking just in an app for learning languages. Even the first day I saw that he's different, not like all. Very soon I clearly realized how wonderful is this man. He's so smart that can do anything he wants, he's so kind that he will always be an amazing friend for every person, he can make you smile, laugh, he always ready to support. He is very special.

<BR>We spent a long time only texting but then came the big day for us, our first Skype. I was so nervous. But when I saw him smiling, looking at me with something special in his eyes, I felt something so weird in my heart. We had a lot of nice moment per such a short time.

After our conversation he always told "I remember that time. You were laughing and looking at the floor. I was happy seeing this."</BR>

That day everything started. Every day we felt more and more for each other and once each of us felt love. I never could imagine that he would love me, but he did. He loved with the biggest love in this world.</BR>

<BR>With time the filings were growing and we started asking "who we are for each other?". Every one wanted to hear "I love you" or "I want to spend my life with you", but we both were so shy that couldn't say this. Once I texted Alfredo in Russian "Я тебя люблю" but he didn't know what it meant.</BR>

<BR>I remember, when we felt something so special but even more than love, and Alfredo said "when we feel something like that but can't express it, let's call it «Trotsky»" , I will never forget this.

<BR>The day we said to each other love words, we couldn't stop saying it anymore. We became so special for each other, so meaningful. I so love when he called me "darling", but he did it not often, he said this word was for special moments only.</BR>

<BR>That time we started calling each other so often, every morning and every evening. It were the only possible ways having time differences of 12 hours. Often I

went to sleep at 4 or 5 because I couldn't go from my dear, I wanted to spend more and more time with him.</BR>

<BR>It was so difficult for us to be without each other, seeing hugging or kissing couples but not being able to meet... We both were crying a lot, but the same time were happy that we're together. We always believed we're the best couple, that we love like nobody loves. I still believe so.</BR>

<BR>We were sending gifts, letters to each other. It was very important part, we did it with love.</BR>

<BR>Now all my family knows about our relationship, I told only to my mother but seems her work is to be a radio d: so a few days ago I met a friend of my mother friend that I don't even know and she said "oh I already know everything;)". Of course I wish about my special person knew only the most clothes people for me, but I can't change it so it's just funny. Alfredo's parents also know about me and I'm so happy about this. I love his parents very much. His mother is so nice. She said I'm part of their family. And his father is also amazing, he always helps Alfredo, loves him. I love this family.</BR>

<BR>In summer I went to a trip where I didn't have internet connection for 2 weeks. It was so hard, I was crying a lot especially the first days. I needed his voice, his smile. To know that he's fine and doesn't have any problems. Every day I went to a huge stone that was lying on the middle of the river, I don't know why but there I felt him closer. There I could think and dream of him. And as soon as I got internet I called him. He was sleeping and said something in Spanish, but when he heard my voice he looked so happy. We were talking a lot, discussing different things. We realized that can't be without each other, we so needed us. That day our love became even bigger, as I think and feel.</BR>

<BR>The next time I went to a trip my dear was supporting me a lot in everything. He's the only person who can be really happy for another people, wishing the the best. So every day, when I even was lazy, he made me go and do something, made me to share moments of the trip. It helped me a lot.</BR>

<BR>My Alfredo is amazing in everything so he always was interested in studying, researchers, competitions, in so proud of him. He won a lot of times, once he won't even an USA company and they invited him. It means a lot for me. My beloved man is very smart, like I always dreamed to be with someone like him.</BR>

<BR>We realized that we want to spend our life together and started searching options for this. I'm sad I didn't do much, I just couldn't because of my age, but Alfredo did a huge work. He was accepted in a dual degree program in the best universities of Russia. He said, he did it for me. I had an ocean of tears of happiness that day. It meant soon we will be together, soon we can build our life together, we will hug, kiss, make each other more happy and a lot of things. We both were so happy, extremely happy. We couldn't believe it happened. We made a plan that first Alfredo studies here and I graduate in one year and try to get accepted in Moscow. So we would be fully together. Then alfredo would find a work for a while here while I'm studying and after I graduate from uni we move to another country to have a better life. He maybe would work or maybe do phd, depends on what he wants. And I would study for master or also work. But it would be a happy time.</BR>

<BR>We had so big dreams, about how we will live together... that sometimes alfredo cooks for me, sometimes I do him surprises, we often travel to different countries. When Alfredo went to sleep, we discussed how we imagine our honeymoon, we thought it will be a very wonderful moment. We dreamed a lot. Alfredo told me "Anastasia, when I close my eyes I see you caring about me when

I'm old. It makes me happy" and it made also me happy. Our dreams always were big and we always were sure that we will always be together.</BR>

<BR>Finally that day happened, Alfredo was coming to Russia! I was so worried about him, I'm scared of planes, I didn't sleep the whole night waiting for the news. Everything was fine and alfredo came healthy.</BR>

<BR>After it I was like crazy waiting for my beloved. This day happened. In a few mins I will see alfredo in the airport. But I'm so scared, so worried. I don't know what is better: to come clothed to the door or no, better far. My hands are shaking, heart beating... People, people, people. A lot of people everywhere but I don't see my man. I was almost running because of the stress but then... I see Alfredo. I see my favorite curly long hair, this so close person, my beloved man. And just didn't know what should I do. I run to him and hugged. He hugged me to but was very shy. We sat and he kissed me. Then we talked, were smiling, I couldn't stop touching his hand and face. Oh by the way, this great cook (me) made a coffee, thinking that alfredo will be sleepy and will want to drink. But what do you think? "Pff, your coffee is horrible. Never do it again". The best words for first meeting, hahah, my dear. Then we went to my home and met my parents, they loved him a lot. We went to our room and staid in the apartment alone. We were lying on the bed, hugging very strong, looking in the eyes of each other to never forget, feeling the warmth of each other and a lot of things. These days were the best ones in our lives. We made everything so special. We had the first date, went to movies, cooked for each other. While Alfredo was sleeping I loved to kiss him. It was very nice:)</BR>

<BR>Alfredo's hugs were like tons of support and love for me. His kisses made me feel special and happy. I want to repeat it sooner.</BR>

<BR>The day he has to arrive was difficult for both of us but we could overcome it. We were planing another meeting and one very special one: New Year trip. Why would it be special? Because we would be just alone, nobody districts, we enjoy each other, spend night together, hugging very gently, and would wake up seeing smiles of me and Alfredo. We would visit different places sharing happy moments, would have new experience. Yesterday I was learning how to cook new dishes for alfredo. I wanted to surprise him.</BR>

<BR>But I was stupid, I did a huge mistake. I made my Alfredo feel uncomfortable and sad. I never wanted it. What I want is only to make him very happy, to share happiness with him, to see his smile again. To hear love words again. But I don't know if he wants to be with me still. It's so unfair, we're having a quarrel being not close to each other. It's unfair. If I would be with him, I would never make him sad, I would be able to hug him and to shove my love. I'm so scared to lose him. He's a huge part of my life. He changed my life and made me a better person. He made me happy.</BR>

<BR>I regret, I repent, my Alfredo. Please never leave me. I became the woman you loved again. You fixed bad parts about me and I became better. This night was horrible to me. I woke up not less than 10 time and my heart sank "is that the end? Is it really possible? I will never have a happy life again? I won't be able to kiss my sunshine. No, it's impossible, we love each other so much." I cried a lot that time because you're very important in my life, I want to be better for you, I want to be happy with you.</BR>

<BR>I ask for your forgiveness and a new chance for us. I beg you. You will see I'm the old Anastasia you loved. I will never talk bad to you and will pay more attention to important things. I will never force you or put pressure. Everything will be like before. We can't leave what we were building for so long time. We were trying to be close for 2 years, we were doing a lot of things and put a lot of efforts. We can't lose

it. I'm sorry for everything I did, but you're the best, the best in my life, the best in this world. Remember good please and let all life to be good. We will be support for each other.</BR>

<BR>Now I'm with my Alef you have for my birthday, in your tshirt that smells amazing, with a lot of your things.</BR>

<BR>I love you, мой любимый. Прости меня. Будь со мной. Прошу.</BR>
